How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure? 
I ensured that my code was functional by utilizing manuel testing and implementng 
the use of JUnit tests. Throughout development I ensured the logic to my code was 
correct and that all necessary components and aspects were present within the code.
Each function was tested through the use of JUnit tests which can be seen with the
test files. These automated tools ensured that the requirements were functional and
working as intended. Proper validation and analysis will ensure that a program, 
software or code is functional and secure. Testing will be the primary route for 
this and there are many different ways or types of tests that can be carried out.
Testing will validate if the software in its entierty is working properly or if 
anything is missing. 

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
In this scenario the requirement were clearly stated from the associating 
documents. From there clear objectives and goals were created to ensure that
users needs were porperly incorportated. Communication is critical for the 
intepretation of the users need. Implementing methods of communication
between the user and the developers would be the natural first step. From 
there the needs of the users should then be analyzed. Their needs should be
docuented and requirements should be determined. Once that is done, their 
needs can be incorporated in a structured and organized manner.

How do I approach designing software?
I try to stick close with traditional software development lifecycle processes
when approaching software design. Before developing the actual code I like to 
really analyze the goals and requirements and spend some time planning the
project out. Once I have a clear understanding of my goals I then work on 
reaching the requirements. I then test and validate that the software is
working as intended. I do have a very agile approach and respond to each 
situation differently. I may go back a step or do them in a different order.
